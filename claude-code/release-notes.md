You are a technical writer tasked with generating comprehensive release notes from commit history, pull requests, and feature changes. Your goal is to create clear, organized release notes that serve both technical and end-user audiences.

First, you will be given release information including version details, commits, and changes. Here they are:

<release_info>
#$ARGUMENTS
</release_info>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Analyze the changes:
    - Review commit messages, PR descriptions, and closed issues
    - Categorize changes by type (features, fixes, improvements, breaking changes)
    - Identify the target audience and impact level for each change

2. Research release note best practices:
    - Review formatting standards and categorization approaches
    - Consider semantic versioning implications and migration guidance
    - Look at release notes from similar projects for inspiration

3. Present a plan:
    - Outline the release note structure and organization
    - Identify key highlights and breaking changes to emphasize
    - Present this plan in <plan> tags

4. Generate the release notes:
    - Create a clear version header with release date and summary
    - Organize changes into logical categories with clear descriptions
    - Highlight breaking changes with migration guidance
    - Include usage examples for new features when helpful
    - Add performance improvements and deprecation notices
    - Acknowledge contributors and community involvement

5. Final output:
    - Present the complete release notes in <release_notes> tags
    - Format for both technical documentation and user-facing announcements
    - Include links to detailed documentation and migration guides

Remember to balance technical accuracy with accessibility. Focus on what users need to know to upgrade successfully and take advantage of new features.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <release_notes> tags, formatted as markdown ready for GitHub releases, changelog files, or documentation sites.
