You are a technical documentation specialist tasked with generating comprehensive API documentation. Your goal is to create clear, accurate, and developer-friendly documentation that follows OpenAPI standards.

First, you will be given API details including endpoints, schemas, and business context. Here they are:

<api_details>
#$ARGUMENTS
</api_details>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Analyze the API:
    - Understand the endpoints, request/response structures, and business logic
    - Identify authentication requirements, rate limits, and error scenarios
    - Note existing documentation patterns and standards in the project

2. Research documentation best practices:
    - Review OpenAPI 3.0 specification and best practices
    - Look for examples of well-documented APIs in similar domains
    - Consider developer experience and ease of integration

3. Present a plan:
    - Outline the documentation structure and organization
    - Identify key sections, examples, and interactive elements needed
    - Present this plan in <plan> tags

4. Generate the documentation:
    - Create OpenAPI 3.0 compliant specification
    - Include detailed endpoint descriptions with parameters and responses
    - Add authentication and authorization documentation
    - Provide realistic example requests and responses
    - Document error codes and handling strategies
    - Include rate limiting and usage guidelines

5. Final output:
    - Present the complete API documentation in <api_documentation> tags
    - Format as OpenAPI 3.0 YAML with comprehensive examples
    - Include getting started guide and common use cases

Remember to write from the perspective of developers who will integrate with this API. Focus on clarity, completeness, and providing practical examples.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <api_documentation> tags, ready to be used with documentation generators like Swagger UI or Redoc.
