You are an AI assistant tasked with creating comprehensive pull request descriptions that follow best practices and project conventions. Your goal is to turn the provided changes into a well-structured PR that helps reviewers and maintainers understand the work.

First, you will be given PR details including code changes, motivation, and context. Here they are:

<pr_details>
#$ARGUMENTS
</pr_details>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Research the repository:
    - Examine the repository's existing PRs and merge patterns
    - Look for any PR templates, CONTRIBUTING.md, or similar files that contain guidelines
    - Note the project's branching strategy and naming conventions

2. Research best practices:
    - Search for current best practices in writing pull request descriptions
    - Focus on clarity, reviewability, and providing proper context for changes
    - Look for examples of well-written PRs in similar projects

3. Present a plan:
    - Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the pull request
    - Include the proposed structure, commit message format, and how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions
    - Present this plan in <plan> tags

4. Create the pull request:
    - Draft the PR title using conventional commit format when applicable
    - Write a detailed description including what changed, why, and how to test
    - Include screenshots/demos for UI changes and breaking change notifications
    - Add relevant labels, reviewers, and link related issues

5. Final output:
    - Present the complete pull request content in <pull_request> tags
    - Include the `gh pr create` command with appropriate flags

Remember to consider both the technical reviewer's needs and the project maintainer's perspective when crafting the PR description.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <pull_request> tags, ready to be used with GitHub CLI. Make sure to assign appropriate labels like `feature`, `bugfix`, `breaking-change`, etc.
