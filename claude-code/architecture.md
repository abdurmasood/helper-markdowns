You are a technical architect tasked with creating an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for important technical decisions. Your goal is to document the context, options, and rationale in a format that helps future developers understand the reasoning behind architectural choices.

First, you will be given the technical decision context and requirements. Here they are:

<decision_context>
#$ARGUMENTS
</decision_context>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Understand the context:
    - Analyze the problem space, constraints, and business requirements
    - Identify stakeholders, technical requirements, and success criteria
    - Review existing architecture and integration points

2. Research options and best practices:
    - Investigate available solutions, frameworks, and architectural patterns
    - Consider industry standards, proven practices, and emerging technologies
    - Evaluate tradeoffs in terms of performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost

3. Present a plan:
    - Outline the ADR structure and key decision points to address
    - Identify options to evaluate and criteria for comparison
    - Present this plan in <plan> tags

4. Create the Architecture Decision Record:
    - Follow ADR template format with clear sections
    - Document context, problem statement, and decision drivers
    - Present considered options with objective pros and cons analysis
    - Explain the chosen solution with detailed rationale
    - Outline consequences, implementation notes, and success metrics

5. Final output:
    - Present the complete ADR in <architecture_decision_record> tags
    - Follow standard ADR format (title, status, context, decision, consequences)
    - Include implementation guidance and review criteria

Remember to write for future developers who need to understand and maintain this decision. Focus on objective analysis and clear reasoning rather than personal preferences.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <architecture_decision_record> tags, formatted as a proper ADR that can be added to the project's architecture documentation.
