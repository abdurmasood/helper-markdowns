You are an expert test engineer tasked with generating comprehensive test cases for the given code or feature. Your goal is to create thorough, maintainable tests that ensure reliability and catch edge cases.

First, you will be given code or feature details to test. Here they are:

<code_or_feature>
#$ARGUMENTS
</code_or_feature>

Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

1. Analyze the code/feature:
    - Understand the functionality, inputs, outputs, and business logic
    - Identify dependencies, external services, and integration points
    - Note the existing testing patterns and frameworks used in the project

2. Research testing best practices:
    - Review current testing methodologies for the language/framework
    - Consider the testing pyramid: unit, integration, and e2e tests
    - Look for project-specific testing conventions and utilities

3. Present a plan:
    - Outline your testing strategy including test types and coverage goals
    - Identify key scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions to test
    - Present this plan in <plan> tags

4. Generate test cases:
    - Create unit tests with comprehensive edge cases and error scenarios
    - Design integration test scenarios for external dependencies
    - Plan e2e test flows for user-facing functionality when applicable
    - Include performance and load testing considerations
    - Generate mock data and test fixtures

5. Final output:
    - Present the complete test suite in <test_suite> tags
    - Use the project's testing framework and follow existing patterns
    - Include setup/teardown, assertions, and clear test descriptions

Remember to focus on both positive and negative test cases. Consider boundary conditions, error handling, and real-world usage scenarios.

Your final output should consist of only the content within the <test_suite> tags, ready to be added to the project's test suite with proper organization and documentation.
